  </user:input>
  <score>4</score>
  <score_reasons>
  - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters,the cells are just blank.
  - BAD: the beginning senetnce is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
  - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs,because the student needs to figure that out.
  - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want sentence strucure something like this:[Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Let's break down the sentence "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?" into Japanese.
    Vocabulary Table:
    | Japanese | Romaji | English
    |          |  kuma	|  bear
    |          |   doa	|  door
    |          |   gomi	| garbage
    |          |   dasu	| to put out
    |          |  shita	| did (past tense of suru, but here we will use dictionary form) suru
    |          |    aru	| to be (inanimate objects)
    |          |    iru	| to be (animate objects)
    |soko ni   |soko ni	|there
    |uchi no mae ni|	uchi no mae ni|	at the door / in front of the house
    Possible Sentence Structure:
    The sentence can be divided into two parts: "Bears are at the door" and "did you leave the garbage out?" In Japanese, this could be structured as:
    (kuma wa doa ni imasu) + (gomi o dashita no desu ka?)
    However, a more natural way to phrase it might be:
    Kuma ga uchi no mae ni imasu. Gomi o dashimashita ka?
    Clues:
    Use the verb "imasu" (to exist, animate object) for bears.
    Use the verb "arimasu" doesn't fit well here since bears are animate, but "aru" fits for inanimate objects like garbage or door.
    The sentence "did you leave the garbage out?" is a question, so you'll need to use the question marker "ka" at the end.
    "At the door" can be expressed as "uchi no mae ni" or "doa no mae ni".
    "Leave something out" can be expressed using the verb "dasu".
    Now it's your turn! Try to transcribe the sentence into Japanese using the vocabulary and clues provided. If you need more help or clarification, feel free to ask.

    I'll help you work through transcribing this English sentence into Japanese! Let's break it down step by step.
    The sentence you want to transcribe is: "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?"
    Vocabulary Table
    Japanese Romaji English
    熊 kuma bear

    Possible Sentence Structure
    For this sentence, we need to break it into two parts:

    "Bears are at the door" - This is a statement about location
    "Did you leave the garbage out?" - This is a question about a past action

    For the first part, in Japanese, location expressions typically follow the pattern:
    [Subject] + [Location] + [Existence verb]
    For the second part, a question about past action follows:
    [Subject] + [Object] + [Verb in past form] + か?
    Clues

    For "Bears are at the door":

    Start with the subject "bears" (熊)
    You'll need a particle to mark the subject
    Then express the location "at the door" (ドア)
    You'll need a particle that indicates location
    Finally, use the appropriate existence verb


    For "Did you leave the garbage out?":

    This is a question, so it will end with か
    You need to conjugate 出す to the past tense
    Consider which particle to use with ゴミ



    Try forming the sentence with these clues! Remember to think about the appropriate particles and verb conjugations.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
